PROBLEM:

Open source software allows developers to access and update code for free. It opens doors to create better code because of the chances given for more developers to access the code. There are multiple websites that offer open source, most notably Sourceforge.com, github.com, and googlecode.com. In todays world, companies are turning to the open-source community as a cheaper alternative to develop code. Code doesn't have to be developed from scratch meaning less overhead in man hours. This also allows the company to dedicate more man hours towards other projects. Using open-software in a corporate setting means there can be licenses and vulnerabiities in the code. 
As a user of open-source we need to abide by any license attached and fix any vulnerabilities in the code.
